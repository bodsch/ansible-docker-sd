If `latest` is set for `docker_sd_version`, the role tries to install the latest release version.  
**Please use this with caution, as incompatibilities between releases may occur!**

The binaries are installed below `/opt/docker-sd/${docker-sd_version}` and later linked to `/usr/sbin`. 
This should make it possible to downgrade relatively safely.

The Source archive is stored on the Ansible controller, unpacked and then the binaries are copied to the target system.
The cache directory can be defined via the environment variable `CUSTOM_LOCAL_TMP_DIRECTORY`. 
By default it is `${HOME}/.cache/ansible/docker-sd`.
If this type of installation is not desired, the download can take place directly on the target system. 
However, this must be explicitly activated by setting `docker_sd_direct_download` to `true`.
